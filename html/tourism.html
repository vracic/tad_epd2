        Zagreb is an important tourist center, not only in terms of passengers traveling from the rest of Europe to the Adriatic Sea but also as a travel destination itself. 
        Since the end of the war, it has attracted close to a million visitors annually, mainly from Austria, Germany, and Italy, and in recent years many tourists from far east (South Korea, Japan, China and India). 
        It has become an important tourist destination, not only in Croatia, but considering the whole region of southeastern Europe. 
        There are many interesting sights and happenings for tourists to attend in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the Republic of Croatia Square, the other at the Stone Gate, where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be the only thing that did not burn in the 17th-century fire. 
        Also, there is an art installation starting in the BogoviÄ‡eva Street, called Nine Views. 
        Zagreb is also famous for its award-winning Christmas market that had been named the one in Europe for three years in a row (2015, 2016, 2017) by European Best Destinations. 
        The capital is also known for its top Restaurants in Zagreb that offer more than traditional Croatian food and classic dishes.
