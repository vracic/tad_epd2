        Zagreb is home to numerous sports and recreational centers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Recreational Sports Center Jarun</u>, situated on Jarun Lake in the southwest of the city, has fine shingle beaches, a world-class regatta course, a jogging lane around the lake, several restaurants, many night clubs and a discothèque. 
        Its sports and recreation opportunities include swimming, sunbathing, waterskiing, angling, and other water sports, but also beach volleyball, football, basketball, handball, table tennis, and mini-golf. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Arena Zagreb</u> was finished in 2008. 
        The 16,500-seat arena hosted the 2009 World Men's Handball Championship. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Sports Park Mladost</u>, situated on the embankment of the Sava river, has an Olympic-size swimming pool, smaller indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a sunbathing terrace, 16 tennis courts as well as basketball, volleyball, handball, football and field hockey courts. 
        A volleyball sports hall is within the park. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Sports and Recreational Center Šalata</u>, located in Šalata, only a couple hundred meters from the Jelačić Square, is most attractive for tennis players. 
        It comprises a big tennis court and eight smaller ones, two of which are covered by the so-called "balloon", and another two equipped with lights. 
        The center also has swimming pools, basketball courts, football fields, a gym, and fitness center, and a four-lane bowling alley. 
        Outdoor ice skating is a popular winter recreation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The 38,923-seat <u>Maksimir Stadium</u>, is located in Maksimir in the northeastern part of the city. 
        The stadium is part of the immense Svetice recreational and sports complex (ŠRC Svetice), south of the Maksimir Park. 
        The complex covers an area of 276,440 m2. 
        It is part of a significant green zone, which passes from Medvednica in the north toward the south. 
        ŠRC Svetice, together with Maksimir Park, creates an ideal connection of areas which are assigned to sport, recreation, and leisure.
