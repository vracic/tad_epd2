                The history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against the Kingdom of Croatia, founded a diocese. 
                Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill, with the border between the two formed by the Medveščak stream. 
                Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and is one of the best-preserved urban nuclei in Croatia.
                <hr>
                As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars, the Croatian and Hungarian King Béla IV granted Gradec the Golden Bull of 1242, which gave its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as their own judicial system.

                The development of Kaptol began in 1094 after the foundation of the diocese, while the growth of Gradec began after the Golden Bull was issued in 1242. 
                In the history of the city of Zagreb, there have been numerous conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol, mainly due to disputed issues of rent collection and due to disputed properties.
                <br>
                In the conflicts between Gradec and Kaptol, there were several massacres of the citizens, destruction of houses and looting of citizens. 
                <hr>
                In 1850, Gradec and Kaptol, with surrounding settlements, were united into a single settlement, today's city of Zagreb.

                The area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction-boom after World War II. 
                After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb), originally called "Južni Zagreb" (Southern Zagreb). 
                From 1999 Novi Zagreb has comprised two city districts: Novi Zagreb – zapad (New Zagreb – West) and Novi Zagreb – istok (New Zagreb – East).
                <br>
                The city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato, and other settlements.
                <br>
                An urbanized area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zaprešić, Samobor, Dugo Selo, and Velika Gorica. 
                Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.
                <br>
                In 2020 the city experienced a 5.5 magnitude earthquake, which damaged various buildings in the historic downtown area. 
                The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers.
